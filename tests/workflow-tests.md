## Test Execution Log

### Test Session: 2026-02-10

**Final Results**: 137 passed, 0 failed, 3 blocked, 5 untested, 20 not shipped (1 remaining known issue: search index)

**Untested** (5 items):
- 3.3: Arrow keys navigate command list (likely works, not explicitly verified)
- 3.7: Switch account via command palette (only one account in demo)
- 4.13: Save as draft (no explicit Save Draft button found)
- 5.8: Individual dismiss in archive-ready list (not verified)
- 7.4: Snoozed email zzz indicator (snoozed section exists but indicator not confirmed)

**Bugs Found** (5 failures — all fixed and verified):
1. **`gg` shortcut doesn't work (1.7)**: ~~Pressing `g` then `g` from any position doesn't jump to first email.~~ **FIXED** — `g` prefix guard now excludes `shiftKey` so `G` (go-to-bottom) doesn't interfere with `gg` sequence. Verified: jumps to first email.
2. **`?` opens search instead of shortcuts help (1.12)**: ~~`?` (Shift+/) opens the search modal instead of keyboard shortcuts.~~ **FIXED** — `/` handler now checks `!e.shiftKey`, letting `?` fall through to its own `case "?"` handler. Verified: opens shortcuts help overlay.
3. **`R` (Shift+R) reply-all doesn't work from email detail (4.3)**: ~~Pressing Shift+R does not open reply-all compose.~~ **FIXED** — Added `case "R"` alongside `case "r"` in keyboard handler. Verified: opens reply-all with CC recipients.
4. **Reply button broken after sending forward (4.5)**: ~~After sending a forward, clicking Reply button doesn't open compose.~~ **FIXED** — Buttons now use `replyTargetEmailId` (last received email) instead of `latestEmail.id` (which becomes the sent message after send). Also added cleanup on getReplyInfo failure. Verified: Reply button works after forward send.
5. **Forward button broken after sending reply (16.21)**: ~~Same bug in reverse.~~ **FIXED** — Same root cause fix as #4. Verified: Forward button works after reply send.

**Additional fixes applied**:
6. **`#` via Shift+3 (not in original bug list)**: Added `case "3"` with `shiftKey` guard so Shift+3 triggers trash. Verified: inbox 14→13.
7. **Archive button now auto-advances (was inconsistency)**: Archive button in email detail now auto-advances to next email, matching the `e` shortcut behavior. Verified: advances to next email instead of returning to inbox.

**Blocked** (3 items):
- 7.6: Snoozed email return - requires real-time wait for snooze timer
- 9.4: Draft refinement - requires Anthropic API key
- 9.7: Create draft in Gmail - requires API key to generate draft first

**Notable Observations**:
- `e` and Archive button both auto-advance to next email (Superhuman-style) after fix #7
- Delete button returns to inbox (doesn't auto-advance)
- Mark as unread from detail returns to inbox
- Search index doesn't match all fields: "quarterly" didn't find Emily Watson's "Q3 Quarterly Report" subject but "Emily" matched sender name
- Demo mode Refresh reloads all demo data, restoring previously archived/deleted emails
- Compose autocomplete shows suggestions when typing in To field
- Product Team newsletter email has an Unsubscribe button (auto-detected from email content)
- "Undo Send" feature (configurable Off/5s/10s/15s/30s) only covers send actions. No undo for archive or delete — those are immediate and irreversible
- Undo Send works correctly: clicking Undo restores compose editor with the original draft text, cancelling the send
